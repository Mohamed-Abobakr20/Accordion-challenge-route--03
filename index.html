                <summary>What is HTML?</summary>
                <p>
                    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes.

                <summary>What is CSS?</summary>
                <p>
                    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets language and is used to stylize elements written in a markup language such as HTML. It separates the content from the visual representation of the site. The relation between HTML and CSS is strongly tied together
                    since HTML is the very foundation of a site and CSS is all of the aesthetics of an entire website.

                <summary>What is JS?</summary>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive
                    maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

                <summary>What is JQuery?</summary>
                <p>
                    jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination
                    of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

                <summary>Angular VS React</summary>
                <p>
                    Both frameworks have distinct abilities to build high-performing web apps. But which is faster? While React has quite a good reputation for boosting performance, Angular isn’t lagging anywhere in the competition.
